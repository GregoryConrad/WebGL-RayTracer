# WebGL Ray Tracing Example
**Created by Gregory Conrad**

## Description
A relatively simple ray tracer built with WebGL that showcases several different scenes.

This ray tracer supports:
- Animation
- Singular light source (using Phong model)
- Arbitrary number of reflections
- Various types of objects (planes and spheres)
Refractions and other world object types could be added in fairly easily but that is outside the scope of this simple demo.

Note: this project is a largely modified version of the starter code supplied in CS 543 at WPI.
